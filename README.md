  ## Instructions
  To use this product, you will need a SQL Database Management program (preferrably MySQL Workbench).
  - In your terminal, run the "npm install" command to download the dependencies necessary for this project
  - In your SQL database management program, please run the SQL code in the Schema.sql file to proprerly set up the database
  - In the index.js file, make sure to enter your SQL database password on line 14 to ensure a successful database connection
  - Use the "node index.js" command in your terminal to run the application 

  ## Usage
  On startup, the application will present you with option to manage roles, employees, or departments. You will use one of these options to see more options for each specific category, including viewing, adding to, and deleting from any of the aforementioned categories. 

  If you do not import the test data included in this repository, you should first use this tool to add your desired roles, employees, and departments as necessary (I recommend adding departments first, then roles, then employees).
  
  Please refer to the following for a visual example:

You may select the "View" options for each category as an easier method rather than having to refer directly back to your database program.
